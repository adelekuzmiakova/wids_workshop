The code is compatible with *Python 3.10.x*. 

## ‚≠ê Starting setup:

In your terminal, navigate to the project repository. It is always a good idea to create an isolated Python environment which will contain dependencies **unique** to this project:
```python
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```python
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üí° Common troubleshooting issues:
**Installing Streamlit:** If you do get an [error](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73512185/error-could-not-build-wheels-for-backports-zoneinfo-error-while-installing-dja) `Could not build wheels for backports.zoneinfo`
while installing `streamlit`, run the following command:

```bash
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions/3.8/Headers
```

or add it to your `.zshrc` file, which contains the shell configurations and commands, and source it:

```bash
vim ~/.zshrc
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Library/Frameworks/Python3.framework/Versions/3.8/Headers
source ~/.zshrc
```
